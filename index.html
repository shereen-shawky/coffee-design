            <h3>Quality Products</h3>
            <p>A coffee shop is only as good as it's coffee. A great coffee shop always has a variety of quality coffee types and food items to choose from. Look for different types of beans, varied ways of preparation, and locally sourced products.</p>

            <h3>Customer Service</h3>
            <p>Watch how a business handles customer requests or complaints. This can be a good indicator of how the business is run and what it's priorities are. Businesses that are resistant to change, rude to customers, or unwilling to provide accommodations are red flags. Instead, look for coffee shops that ask for suggestions, work with the customer to reach agreements, and are polite and helpful in all situations.</p>

            <p>One of the major things that sets apart amazing coffee shops from the rest is how they involve their community and culture. The best coffee shops advertise for local events, promote local artists and businesses, and actively involve themselves in activities around their community.</p>
